# Welcome to the official DaisyUI fork and UI toolkit for the QhySync vQoS v3.0 ecosystem!

## Why DaisyUI?

DaisyUI is at the heart of over 1,000 QhySync apps and services powering our open, modular, mobile-first platform. 

We chose DaisyUI as our ecosystem-wide frontend UI standard because of three unbeatable factors:

✨ Beautiful, flexible components: 

1
Out-of-the-box themes, easy color modes, and rapid prototyping

🚀 Extreme ease of use: Intuitive classes, plug-and-play TailwindCSS integration, blazing fast dashboards, zero-brainer theming

💸 Price: FREE (Open Source): All of DaisyUI’s power—at zero licensing cost—for every project and every user

## What is QhySync vQoS v3.0?

QhySync is the universal connected-device dashboard and service ecosystem for the next generation of apps—spanning home, enterprise, and edge cloud. 

With DaisyUI, every app shares a consistent, beautiful UX and rapid developer ramp-up.

## Features We Love

🎨 Theme support (including custom QhySync dark/light/system palette)

📦 Loads of prebuilt components for graphs, controls, IoT dashboards, device cards, modals, forms, and wizard flows

🛠️ Seamless integration with Tailwind and modern JS/TS frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, and more)

🤝 First-class a11y, responsive design, and accessibility baked inEcosystem-Wide Standard

DaisyUI is now our official, organization-wide UI kit! Every app, microservice, control panel, and internal tool uses it as the uniform, extensible, open-source foundation. 

### This keeps our UX:

Consistent (users feel at home)Maintainable (easy upgrades and patches)

Developer-friendly (move fast, build anything, skip the boilerplate)

Zero license cost (forever)

Join the MovementFork, extend, and contribute! 

All QhySync core and community developers should use this DaisyUI fork for all new frontend UI work.

🌟 API Builder App Development Framework

The "API Builder App" offers users a fast and easy 1-click solution to creating API endpoints for software, desktop, mobile, and embedded applications.

Users simply enter the URL of the website where the API endpoints are served.

Here is a step-by-step coding framework using the provided file structure and industry-standard practices:

🚀 Set up the project structureCreate the folder and file hierarchy as outlined.

Initialize a virtual environment (venv/) for dependency management.

Populate requirements.txt with needed Python packages.

⚙️ Configure the applicationDefine all configurations in config.py (e.g., API keys, environment variables).

Enable loading configs from environment or config files (YAML/JSON).

🔍 Implement API documentation scraper and parserCode scraping logic to fetch API docs in apidoc/scraper.py.

Parse the documentation to structured data in apidoc/parser.py.

🛠️ Develop the code generatorIn codegen/generator.py, generate API client code or endpoint snippets.

Use templates from codegen/templates/ for multi-language support.

🧪 Implement the mock serverBuild a mock API server in mock/server.py to simulate endpoints.

Serve test data stored under mock/data/.

✅ Set up testing and performance monitoringWrite functional tests in tests/tester.py.

Add performance tests and metrics gathering in tests/performance.py

🔒 Implement security scanningDevelop security vulnerability scans in security/scanner.py.

Save scan reports to security/reports/.🌐 Build the website frontend/backend

Use website/main.py to build Flask (or chosen framework) app backend.Serve dynamic pages using HTML templates from website/templates/ for docs, mocks, tests, etc.

🖥️ Develop the GUICreate desktop GUI in gui.py using PyQt/Tkinter/wxPython.

Connect GUI with scraping, codegen, mocking, and testing modules.🧩 Integrate and test the full applicationUse main.py as the entry point to run and integrate all components.

Conduct end-to-end tests ensuring proper interaction of modules.

🚀 Deploy and maintainPrepare containerized or cloud deployment pipelines.

Set up CI/CD workflows for automated testing, building, and deployment.

Continuously monitor, update, and improve based on feedback and analytics.

Following this framework will help build a modular, maintainable, and scalable "API Builder App" that provides fast, automated API endpoint creation for various types of applications.
