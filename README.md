🌐 Picture This

Out front, you’ve got Tailscale—the big name in WireGuard-powered networking. Keeps your data locked down tighter than a seed silo at harvest.

Behind the scenes, the real workhorse is tailscaled. That daemon’s the steady ranch hand making sure every encrypted tunnel and API route flows right, dawn to dusk.

GitHub’s already given it over 24,912 stars and more forks than a Sunday buffet. Proof enough this isn’t greenhorn tech.

🧰 The QhySync Way to Build

1. Set Your Foundation

Spin up the file structure, fire up a venv, drop your dependencies in requirements.txt.

2. Configure Smart

Tune config.py and load settings straight from env vars—keys, secrets, endpoints, all wrangled clean.

3. Round Up Your Docs

Scrape ‘em with apidoc/scraper.py, clean ‘em with apidoc/parser.py.

4. Generate Endpoints

Let codegen/generator.py whip up the client code. Pull from templates so it fits your flavor.

5. Mock & Test

Fire up the pretend server in mock/server.py, stash sample data, then test performance in tests/.

6. Scan for Trouble

security/scanner.py hunts down varmints, reports land in security/reports/. Sheriff-ready.

7. Front to Back Integration

website/main.py ties it together. Docs, mock data, dashboards, GUIs—all under one roof.

8. Deploy & Ride On

Drop it in a container, or ship it cloud-side. Keep CI/CD testing like a fence check—regular, reliable.

What you’ve got here is a one-stop builder: secure as a vault, sharp as a new hatchet, and easy as pie to run. From prairie roots to server racks, this system keeps your networks talking and your endpoints humming—all while looking slick under DaisyUI’s shine.
